### AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element

```
